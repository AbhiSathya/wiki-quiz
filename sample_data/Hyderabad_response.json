{"id":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad","title":"Hyderabad","summary":"Hyderabad is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana. It occupies 650 km (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of Southern India. With an average altitude of 536 m (1,759 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India. The Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda. In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. In 1724, Asaf Jah I, the Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahis from 1769 to 1948. As the capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states until 2024. Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam, the winter office of the president of India.","key_entities":{"people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"sections":[],"quiz":[{"question":"Who established Hyderabad and in what year?","options":["Asaf Jah I in 1724","Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah in 1591","Emperor Aurangzeb in 1687","Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib in the 17th century"],"answer":"Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah in 1591","difficulty":"easy","explanation":"The article states: 'The Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda.'"},{"question":"Which of the following bodies of water is mentioned as predating Hyderabad's founding?","options":["Musi River","Hussain Sagar lake","Western Ghats","Deccan Plateau"],"answer":"Hussain Sagar lake","difficulty":"medium","explanation":"The article mentions: '...much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the city centre.'"},{"question":"According to the 2011 census, what was Hyderabad's rank in terms of population among cities in India?","options":["Second-most populous","Third-most populous","Fourth-most populous","Sixth-most populous"],"answer":"Fourth-most populous","difficulty":"easy","explanation":"The article states: 'According to the 2011 census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits...'"},{"question":"Which epithet was given to Hyderabad following the Mughal conquest, according to the article?","options":["Farkhunda Bunyad","Baghnagar","Dar-ul-Jihad","Bhagya-nagar"],"answer":"Dar-ul-Jihad","difficulty":"hard","explanation":"The article states: 'Following the Mughal conquest of Hyderabad, emperor Aurangzeb changed the epithet to Dar-ul-Jihad (lit.
