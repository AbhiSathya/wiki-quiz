{"id":7,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italy","title":"Italy","summary":"Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a country in Southern and Western Europe. It consists of a peninsula that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Alps on its northern land border, as well as nearly 800 islands, notably Sicily and Sardinia. Italy shares land borders with France to the west; Switzerland and Austria to the north; Slovenia to the east; and the two enclaves of Vatican City and San Marino. It is the tenth-largest country in Europe by area, covering 301,340 km (116,350 sq mi), and the third-most populous member state of the European Union, with nearly 59 million inhabitants. Italy's capital and largest city is Rome; other major cities include Milan, Naples, Turin, Palermo, Bologna, Florence, Genoa, and Venice. The history of Italy goes back to numerous Italic peoples, notably including the ancient Romans, who conquered the Mediterranean world during the Roman Republic and ruled it for centuries during the Roman Empire. With the spread of Christianity, Rome became the seat of the Catholic Church and the Papacy. Barbarian invasions and other factors led to the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire between late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. By the 11th century, Italian city-states and maritime republics expanded, bringing renewed prosperity through commerce and laying the groundwork for modern capitalism. The Italian Renaissance flourished during the 15th and 16th centuries and spread to the rest of Europe. Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, contributing significantly to the Age of Discovery.","key_entities":{"people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"sections":[],"quiz":[{"question":"What is the official name of Italy?","options":["Italian Federation","Italian Monarchy","Italian Republic","Italian Commonwealth"],"answer":"Italian Republic","difficulty":"easy","explanation":"The article states: 'Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a country in Southern and Western Europe.'"},{"question":"Which mountain range forms Italy's northern land border?","options":["Pyrenees","Carpathians","Alps","Dolomites"],"answer":"Alps","difficulty":"easy","explanation":"The article mentions: 'It consists of a peninsula that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Alps on its northern land border...'"},{"question":"Approximately how many islands does Italy consist of?","options":["Nearly 100","Nearly 800","Exactly 500","Over 1000"],"answer":"Nearly 800","difficulty":"easy","explanation":"The article states: 'It consists of a peninsula... as well as nearly 800 islands, notably Sicily and Sardinia.'"},{"question":"Which ancient people are notably mentioned as conquering the Mediterranean world during the Roman Republic?","options":["Ancient Greeks","Ancient Egyptians","Ancient Romans","Ancient Gauls"],"answer":"Ancient Romans","difficulty":"easy","explanation":"The article states: 'The history of Italy goes back to numerous Italic peoples, notably including the ancient Romans, who conquered the Mediterranean world during the Roman Republic...'"},{"question":"During which centuries did the Italian Renaissance flourish?","options":["12th and 13th centuries","15th and 16th centuries","17th and 18th centuries","10th and 11th centuries"],"answer":"15th and 16th centuries","difficulty":"medium","explanation":"The article states: 'The Italian Renaissance flourished during the 15th and 16th centuries and spread to the rest of Europe.'"},{"question":"In what year was the Kingdom of Italy established?","options":["1789","1861","1918","1946"],"answer":"1861","difficulty":"medium","explanation":"The article states: 'After centuries of political and territorial divisions, the Kingdom of Italy was established in 1861...'"},{"question":"What political system replaced the monarchy in Italy in 1946?","options":["Empire","Dictatorship","Republic","Federation"],"answer":"Republic","difficulty":"easy","explanation":"The article states: 'In 1946, the monarchy was replaced by a republic and the country made a strong recovery.'"},{"question":"How many World Heritage Sites does Italy have, making it the highest number globally?","options":["45","50","61","72"],"answer":"61","difficulty":"medium","explanation":"The article states: 'It has the highest number of World Heritage Sites (61) and is the fifth-most visited country in the world.'"}],"related_topics":["Roman Empire","Italian Renaissance","European Union","World War II","Vatican City"],"cached":true}
