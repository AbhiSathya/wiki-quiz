{"id":6,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia","title":"Russia","summary":"Russia, or the Russian Federation, is a country in Eastern Europe and North Asia. It is the largest country in the world, spanning eleven time zones and sharing land borders with fourteen countries. With a population of over 140 million, Russia is the most populous country in Europe and the ninth-most populous in the world. It is a highly urbanised country, with sixteen of its urban areas having more than 1 million inhabitants. Moscow, the most populous metropolitan area in Europe, is the capital and largest city of Russia, while Saint Petersburg is its second-largest city and a major cultural centre. Human settlement on the territory of modern Russia dates back to the Lower Paleolithic. The East Slavs emerged in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus', arose in the 9th century, and in 988 adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. The latter ultimately disintegrated, and the Grand Duchy of Moscow led the unification of Russian lands in the late 13th century, leading to the proclamation of the Tsardom of Russia in 1547. By the early 18th century, Russia had expanded vastly through conquest, annexation, and the efforts of Russian explorers, developing into the Russian Empire, the third-largest in history. The Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the monarchic system being abolished and replaced by the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, the first constitutionally socialist state in the world. Following the Russian Civil War, Soviet Russia established the Soviet Union and was its largest and principal constituent. The Soviet Union underwent rapid industrialisation in the 1930s, amidst the death of millions under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin, and later played a decisive role for the Allies in World War II by leading large-scale efforts on the Eastern Front—emerging as a superpower. During the Cold War, it competed with the United States for ideological dominance and international influence. The 20th-century Soviet era saw some of the most significant Russian technological achievements, including the first human-made satellite and the first human expedition into outer space.","key_entities":{"people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"sections":[],"quiz":[{"question":"What is Russia's global ranking in terms of land area?","options":["Second largest country","Third largest country","Largest country","Fourth largest country"],"answer":"Largest country","difficulty":"easy","explanation":"The article states, 'It is the largest country in the world, spanning eleven time zones and sharing land borders with fourteen countries.'"},{"question":"Which city serves as the capital and largest city of Russia?","options":["Saint Petersburg","Moscow","Kazan","Novosibirsk"],"answer":"Moscow","difficulty":"easy","explanation":"The article identifies, 'Moscow, the most populous metropolitan area in Europe, is the capital and largest city of Russia, while Saint Petersburg is its second-largest city and a major cultural centre.'"},{"question":"From which empire did Kievan Rus' adopt Orthodox Christianity in 988?","options":["Roman Empire","Ottoman Empire","Byzantine Empire","Mongol Empire"],"answer":"Byzantine Empire","difficulty":"medium","explanation":"The article states, 'The first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus', arose in the 9th century, and in 988 adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire.'"},{"question":"Which of the following technological achievements is specifically mentioned as occurring during the 20th-century Soviet era?","options":["The invention of the internet","The first human-made satellite","The development of the first atomic bomb","The discovery of penicillin"],"answer":"The first human-made satellite","difficulty":"medium","explanation":"The article mentions, 'The 20th-century Soviet era saw some of the most significant Russian technological achievements, including the first human-made satellite and the first human expedition into outer space.'"},{"question":"In what year did the Russian SFSR emerge as the Russian Federation from the dissolution of the Soviet Union?","options":["1989","1991","1993","2000"],"answer":"1991","difficulty":"easy","explanation":"The article states, 'In 1991, the Russian SFSR emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union as the Russian Federation.'"},{"question":"According to the article, what are the primary resources Russia's advanced economy relies on?","options":["Agricultural products and timber","Mineral and energy resources, mainly oil and natural gas","Manufacturing and technology exports","Tourism and financial services"],"answer":"Mineral and energy resources, mainly oil and natural gas","difficulty":"medium","explanation":"The article states, 'Its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying on its vast mineral and energy resources, mainly oil and natural gas.'"},{"question":"How many UNESCO World Heritage Sites are located in Russia, according to the provided text?","options":["25","32","40","50"],"answer":"32","difficulty":"hard","explanation":"The article explicitly mentions, 'Russia is also home to 32 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.'"},{"question":"Who was the dictator under whose leadership millions died during the rapid industrialisation of the Soviet Union in the 1930s?","options":["Vladimir Lenin","Nikita Khrushchev","Joseph Stalin","Mikhail Gorbachev"],"answer":"Joseph Stalin","difficulty":"medium","explanation":"The article states, 'The Soviet Union underwent rapid industrialisation in the 1930s, amidst the death of millions under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin...'"}],"related_topics":["Soviet Union","Cold War","Kievan Rus'","Russian Empire","Vladimir Putin"],"cached":true}
